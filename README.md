# angular_exercise
Angular Phonecat exercise done without using the angular seed and not adding test.

This is the practice exercise provided by angular.org https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial . I did this exercise without using 
the angular seed, neather the node npm module. I wanted to check every step by my own to better understand what files are added 
and how to organize them.
